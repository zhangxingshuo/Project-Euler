# Project Euler
Project Euler solutions written in Java, Python, and Julia

## Useful solutions
Euler #004 has a function that tests if a number is a palindrome.

Euler #007 has the Sieve of Eratosthenes, an efficient algorithm for generating n prime numbers. 

Euler #017 has an interesting, if not very useful, dictionary that has letter counts for each number. 

Euler #019 has another interesting function for counting Sundays. 

Euler #021 has the divisor generating function, but it probably is not optimized. 

Euler #025 has a dynamic programming implementation of the Fibonacci sequence, but Binet's formula is preferred in most cases. 

Euler #031 has another dynamic programming method to make change. 

Euler #041 has a method to test if a number is <i>n</i>-pandigital.
